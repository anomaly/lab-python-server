"""" Redmail based email helper functions

Refer to documentation for samples, this package essentially providers
what the db or config provide for database environments.

Importing this should give you a email sender configured to send emails
and load templates from the templates folder.

the sender is set to config.EMAIL_FROM so each call does not have to
reference the configuration and can simply provide the template information

> Note: you can however override the sender per call if you so wish to

Redmail docs are located at https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/
