    The following values are read from the container environment, it's

    Note: pydatic sub models allows for the configuration to be
    broken up into classes, it will convert uppercase environment
    variables into lower case python variables and take prefixes
    and break it into sub models.

    e.g DB_HOST will be converted to db.host
